# The Fediverse-Friendly Moderation Covenant

> **Warning**  
> The Fediverse-Friendly Moderation Covenant was written up for a time of the Fediverse that doesn't really apply anymore nowadays.
>
> I highly recommend you write up your own general set of rules in terms of moderation.
> Use the tools you have available to create a space comfortable for yourself and your users.

The Fediverse is, while already existing for a while in all kinds, rapidly growing and changing. Current-day Fediverse software can employ all kinds of moderation, improving on the lack thereof from platforms that were used before (e.g. Twitter), but features given, if used too thoroughly can also impact the integrity of the natural growth and communication of the network.

This covenant isn't here to replace an instance's set of rules. It's simply an extension that administration/moderation can pledge to follow so the networks integrity and the ability of users to interact with as many people as possible is kept intact.

You can find the covenant in [covenant.md](covenant.md). Simply take the raw markdown or text format, adjust it to your needs  and copy it in your instances rules/terms.
